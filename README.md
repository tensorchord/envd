> **‚ö†Ô∏è envd is still under heavy development, and subject to change. it is not feature-complete or production-ready. Please contact us in [discord](https://discord.gg/KqswhpVgdU) if there is any problem.**

envd is a **machine learning development environment** for data scientists, AI/ML engineers, or teams.

üêç **No docker, only python** - Write python code to build the development environment, we help you take care of Docker.

üñ®Ô∏è **Built-in jupyter/vscode** - Jupyter and VSCode remote extension are first-class support.

‚è±Ô∏è **Save time** - Better cache management to save your time, keep the focus on the model, instead of dependencies.

‚òÅÔ∏è **Local & cloud** - envd integrates with Docker seamlessly, you can share, version, and publish envd environments with Docker Hub or any other OCI image registries.

üîÅ **Repeatable builds, reproducible results** - You can reproduce the same dev environment, on your laptop, public cloud VMs, or Docker containers, without any setup or change.

## Why use envd?

It is still too difficult to configure development environments and reproduce results in AI/ML scenarios.

envd is a **machine learning development environment** for data scientists, AI/ML engineers, or teams. Environments built with envd enjoy the following features out-of-the-box:

üêç **Life is short, we use Python[^1]**

Development environments are full of Dockerfiles, bash scripts, Kubernetes YAML manifests, and many other clunky files. And they are always breaking. envd builds are isolated and clean. You can write simple instructions in Python, instead of Bash / Makefile / Dockerfile / ...

![envd](./docs/images/envd.png)

[^1]: The build language is [starlark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/language.html), which is a dialect of Python.

‚è±Ô∏è **Save you plenty of time**

envd adopts a multi-level cache mechanism to accelerate the building process. For example, the PyPI cache is shared between different builds. Thus the package will be cached if it is downloaded before. It saves plenty of time, especially when you update the environment by trial and error.

[^2]: Docker without [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)

‚òÅÔ∏è **Local & cloud native**

envd integrates with Docker seamlessly, you can share, version, and publish envd environments with Docker Hub or any other OCI image registries. And the envd environments can be run on Docker, or Kubernetes.

üîÅ **Repeatable builds, reproducible results**

You can reproduce the same dev environment, on your laptop, public cloud VMs, or Docker containers, without any setup or change. And you can also collaborate with your colleagues without "let me configure the environment in your machine".

üñ®Ô∏è **Seamless experience of jupyter/vsocde** 

Jupyter and VSCode remote extension are first-class support. You benefit without sacrificing any developer experience.

## Documentation

See [envd documentation](https://envd.tensorchord.ai/docs/get-started).

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new envd environment**.

### What you'll need

- Docker (20.10.0 or above)

### Install envd

You can download the binary from the [latest release page](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd/releases/latest), and add it in `$PATH`.

After the download, please run `envd bootstrap` to bootstrap.

> You can add `--dockerhub-mirror` or `-m` flag when running `envd boostrap`, to configure the mirror for docker.io registry:
>
>```bash title="Set docker mirror"
>envd bootstrap --dockerhub-mirror https://docker.mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn
>```

### Create an envd environment

Please clone the [`envd-quick-start`](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd-quick-start):

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorchord/envd-quick-start.git
```

The build manifest `build.envd` looks like:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("zsh")
```

Then please run the command below to setup a new environment:

```
cd envd-quick-start && envd up
```

```

```

### Play with the environment

You can run `ssh envd-quick-start.envd` to reconnect if you exit from the environment. Or you can execute `git` or `python` commands inside.

```bash
$ python demo.py
[2 3 4]
$ git fetch
$
```

### Setup jupyter notebook

Please edit the `build.envd` to enable jupyter notebook:

```python title=build.envd
def build():
    base(os="ubuntu20.04", language="python3")
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("zsh")
    config.jupyter(password="", port=8888)
```

You can get the endpoint of jupyter notebook via `envd get envs`.

```bash
$ envd up --detach
$ envd get env
NAME                    JUPYTER                 SSH TARGET              CONTEXT                                 IMAGE                   GPU     CUDA    CUDNN   STATUS          CONTAINER ID

$ envd resume --env mnist
$ ssh mnist.envd

```

### Configure mirrors

envd supports PyPI mirror and apt source configuration. You can configure them in `build.env` or `$HOME/.config/envd/config.envd` to set up in all environments.

cat ~/.config/envd/config.envd
config.apt_source(source="""
