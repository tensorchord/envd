# PyTorch profiler example

This example is adopted from torch's [official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_profiler_tutorial.html). It shows how to use PyTorch profiler to analyze performance bottlenecks in a model.

## Usage

Run `envd up` at current folder. And execute `python main.py` in the envd container. Then you can see the profiling result through TensorBoard at http://localhost:8888
